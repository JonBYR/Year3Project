Thank you for downloading this project.

This project contains a plug in extension to Unity that recommends would-be directors a film previs (a shot list) that they may wish to consider using for their own films.

This can generate a shoot out scene for an Action, Comedy, Thriller or Western film. It is generated by looking at pre-existing film shot sequences and finding the most common shot at each position of the sequence

Controls:
Use Tools/Genre Generation and type in either Action, Comedy, Thriller or Western into the Genre field. Then click the Start Genre Generation button.
Press the play arrow to see the generated film shot list, using the arrows to flip through each shot
Use WASD to move the camera and the mouse scroll wheel to zoom the camera in and out. Try and experiment with the types of shots the camera can make!
Use F to toggle the image and text on/off
